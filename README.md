## **Project Description**
A graphical user interface was developed, as well as the image processing part with Python. As samples you have a database consisting of images.

Using the GUI the user has the opportunity to:
- Access the home
- Register a new user
- Delete a user
- Return to the main menu

With Arduino, the microcontroller was programmed for the conditioning of the different actuators (LEDs, Servos, Buzzers).

The Arduino code is run on the Microcontroller, and through a Bluetooth module it is connected to the Raspberry Pi 3b +, where the Python program runs.
